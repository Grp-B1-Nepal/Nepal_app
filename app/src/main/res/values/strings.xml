    <string name="info1_1">Your baby is nearly one month old! Soon you will have to entertain your little one.
        Right now though it’s still all about feeding and sleeping.</string>
    <string name="info1_2">Social and emotional development</string>
    <string name="info1_3">Your baby is three months\' old, and you’re probably starting to get the hang of this
        parenting thing. You may have settled into a schedule, or your routine may vary from day to day.
        Either way, your 3 month old has changed from a tiny newborn to an active infant.</string>
    <string name="info1_4">Just when you thought your baby could not get any more adorable,
        he somehow does. At four months, your baby is learning more about himself and also becoming pretty
        fascinated with the world around him.</string>
    <string name="info1_5">By five months old, your baby is certainly showing more personality.
        He may be crying less and babbling more. He is also probably becoming more interested in playing.
        Lots of other fun changes are taking place during the fifth month.</string>
    <string name="info1_6">It may be hard to believe your baby is already six months old.
        You’ll probably see a lot of developmental milestones this month.
        But it’s also important for moms and dads to understand, each baby is a unique individual and may do things
        at their own pace. If you’re concerned about something, don’t hesitate talking to your pediatrician.</string>

    <string name="info2_1">You might notice more of a pattern starting to form around feeding.
        Your baby will probably still require cluster-feeding at night when he needs a lot of feeding in order to
        have enough for the next day. But you are also able to tell whether your baby is hungry, needs a diaper change
        or has colic. You can try to feed a little longer in the evenings now so you can catch more sleep
        during the night.</string>
    <string name="info2_2">You may not think a lot is going on as far as social development,
        but it is. As you love your baby and respond to his cries, you’re building his trust,
        which helps his social and emotional development. \n
Your baby still needs lots of cuddles and skin-to-skin contact, so enjoy quiet time together when you can.
        Research indicates that babies need touch in order to thrive.
        So all those cuddles are actually helping your baby’s development. \n
His emotional development also includes his ability to self-soothe, which he does by sucking.
        2 month old babies have a strong sucking reflex. Your baby may like to suck on a pacifier, his fist or a finger.

Most babies this age also start following objects with their eyes. At two months, your baby’s vision is
        not as sharp as an adult’s, but it is improving.</string>

    <string name="info2_3">One cool thing you may notice is your baby is starting to figure out who’s who.
        While you can’t expect your little one to say mama or dada just yet,
        your baby may be showing signs of parental recognition. For example, when your baby sees you,
        he may kick his legs with excitement or smile at the sound of your voice.

Not only is your baby’s brain developing rapidly, his senses are also becoming more active.
        For example, you may notice your baby turns his head towards sounds. Your 3 month old also thrives on touch,
        so continue to spend a lot of time snuggling and cuddling. Partners, you should also make time
        for skin to skin contact.</string>
    <string name="info2_4">Your baby is likely becoming more social.
        You may notice he copies some facial expressions, such as frowning or smiling.
        He is probably enjoying playing more and may even start to cry when playtime stops.
If you have not already introduced music, now may be a good time to give it a shot.
        Some research indicates music helps babies with their intellectual and social development.
        Consider a baby class, or just sing to your little one. But even with all the social development going on,
        your baby still needs quiet time. Make sure you allow plenty of time for quiet snuggles.</string>
    <string name="info2_5">You may have noticed, your baby’s sense of humor is developing more.
        He’s starting to get the joke. For instance, he may laugh when you make silly faces or use a goofy voice.
        Continue to encourage those adorable giggles with silly chatter. It helps your baby’s social development.

Along with a sense of humor, your baby may be showing a wider range of emotions, such as anger and happiness.
        He may express those varied emotions by grunting when he is mad or squealing when he is happy.

You and your partner can help your baby’s social and emotional development by just doing what you do.
        Every time you respond to a cry, play or cuddle your baby, you’re helping him feel safe and loved.</string>
    <string name="info2_6">It may be hard to believe your baby is already six months old.
        You’ll probably see a lot of developmental milestones this month.
        But it’s also important for moms and dads to understand, each baby is a unique
        individual and may do It may be hard to believe your baby is already six months old.
